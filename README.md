# JS Adventure Game

### What is it?

This project is to make a very basic tile movement "game". I am using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.

### Project Log

- 11/1/19: Set up the inital board and add buttons.
- 11/2/19: Refactor it so I don't have to manually add each square to an array. Add functionality to the buttons and make the "player" move. Bug is present where an extra tile is lit, and the right button doesn't work.
- 11/3/19: Fix the bugs where an extra tile is lit, and fixed the right button. Make this a GitHub Repo. Fix the bug where the player can go out of bounds.
- 11/4/19: Make the board dynamic. Now by changing the "tiles" variable, you can set how big you want the board. Currenly only works with squared numbers (IE 144 or 12 \* 12). I will add a dropdown in the future for users to make the change that way.
